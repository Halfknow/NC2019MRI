    "Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) plays an important role in advanced medical test. However, the long acquisition time in MRI often exceeds half an hour which results in low patient throughput and high patient anxiety. Hence, a faster MRI process is required to reduce the examination cost and to provide a more comfortable experience for patients. People gradually pay more attention on safety problems caused by its long duration in MRI machines as well. Some acute diseases intrinsically requires the treatment measures to provide fast and valid judgement on the state of illness since long diagnosis time will deteriorate the patients' condition and lead to secondary injury."

The number of output channels starts from 16, which is doubled in the second layer. The last convolutional layer is applied with a kernel size of 1 to reduce the channels of feature maps in a single perceptron. \n",

In this model, we choose the ReLU function to make every iteration faster. After activation, feature space is reduced by a pooling layer. The pooling layer is mainly used for feature dimension reduction, by compressing the number of data and parameters. It helps to reduce model verfitting, and improves the fault tolerance of the model. Here we choose a max pooling over a (2, 2) window.\n",

The feature that allows images to be directly entered on the network avoids the complexity of rebuilding data when retrieving and classifying features.Maybe the performance of CNN used for MRI processing is not well."

However, this information generally includes two types: one is environmental field information, and the other is detailed information. The pixel-based approach has a great deal of uncertainty about the choice of the form. Choosing a size that is too large not only requires more pooling layers to make the environmental information appear, but also loses the local detailed information. But U-net uses a network structure that includes both down sampling and up sampling. Down sampling is used to gradually display the environmental information, and the process of up sampling is to combine the down sampling information of each layer and up sampling input information to restore the detailed information, and gradually restore the image accurately. Besides, U-Net combines the location information from the down sampling path to finally obtain a general information combining localization and context, which is necessary to predict a good segmentation map."

    "- Down sampling part is also called the feature extraction. U-NET starts with one channel. Firstly, each convolutional layer did stride-2 convolution operations, and then we encapsulate these two convolution layers into a class ConvBlock. Specifically, each convolution layer followed by kernel, instance normalization, ReLU activation and drop out, kernel size is 3 * 3 and the number of channels doubles after the first convolution operation, and remains the same the second time.They lose two pixels for every stride-2 convolution because of a lack of padding.After the first 3X3 convolution operation after each pooling layer, the number of 3X3 convolution kernels doubles. Dropout is often used to randomly delete some neurons in a neural network to prevent overfitting and optimize the model by using normalization at the same time. Then, We choose a max pooling over a (2, 2) window used to half the size of feature map. Then again, the convolution and max-pooling steps are followed until the last pool layer. The number of pool layers depends on experimenters.\n",
    "- Up sampling, which is also known as deconvolution, or transpose convolution, is a critical part of U-net. There is a way, know as bilinear interpolation which means the feature map merged at the same scale as the number of channels corresponding to the feature extraction part. Therefore, before merging, the model will copy and crop the feature map in the shallow layers, which results in the final output is a region in the center of the input.After the first 3x3 convolution operation after each merging, the number of 3X3 convolution kernels becomes half. Unlike down sampling, up sampling double the size of image. And then passing through ConvBlock. Finally, in the last layer, we use the kernel 1 * 1 to accept the output image.\n",
    "U-NET is derived from CNN. U-shaped structure is the biggest feature of U-NET. U-NET performs several down sampling and use the contact connection on the corresponding layer, which ensured that the finally recovered feature maps incorporated more low-level features. Multiple up sampling also makes the information such as edge restoration of the image more detailed."

Explicitly, K-space uses spatial frequency as the unit (Hz / cm), the spatial frequency K is described by the three mutually perpendicular components Kx, Ky, and Kz.

The SSIM algorithm is designed to take into account the visual characteristics of the human eye and it is more in line with the human eye's visual perception than traditional methods. MSE or PSNR algorithms are both evaluations of absolute errors. For the fuzzy changes in the human's perception of the structural information of the image, the model also introduces some perception phenomena related to the changes in perception, including the brightness mask and the contrast mask.
